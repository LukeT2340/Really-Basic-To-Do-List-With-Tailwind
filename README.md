# Basic To-Do List

This project is a basic to-do list application built using React, Express, and MongoDB, and styled with Tailwind CSS. I made this project as a means to learn and practice tailwind css. It is very basic. It does not even have authentication so everyone will see the same to-do list.

## Features

- Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- Update existing tasks.
- Delete tasks from the list.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Backend**: Express.js for API endpoints.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing tasks.
